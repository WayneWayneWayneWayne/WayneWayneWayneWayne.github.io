<p style="font-family:arial">Last week, A Russian backed hacker group with the official name of APT 29, better known as “cozy bear” hacked into the Microsoft Executives emails. This was the same group that hacked the Solar Winds supply chain back in 2020, allowing them access to the Pentagon, and the DNC in 2015.

<p style="font-family:arial">On Sunday, January 21, 2024, The F.A.A. recommended that airlines check the door plugs on all 737-900ER planes after grounding 170 Boeing 737 Max 9 places, which is covered by the New York Times article, “F.A.A. Tells Airlines to Check Panels on a Second Boeing Plane,” Reported by Mark Walker on January 22, 2024. This is since, as shown by the January 21 F.A.A. announcement (See link under summary), Although the 900ER is not part of the newer M.A.X. line, Many of them have the same door plug design, meaning that it could still rip off from the plane mid-flight, and potentially cause injuries. This all happened after the January 5th Alaska Airlines accident, where a door panel broke off of the plane, sucking out items from the passengers. Fortunately, no one was seated on the aisle when the panel broke off. There were no injuries, but the FAA grounded 170 737 Max 9s and now told all pilots using the 737 900ER to check the door plugs, which the FAA suspects was the cause of the incident.
